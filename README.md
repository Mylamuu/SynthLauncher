**SynthLauncher** is an open-source Minecraft launcher designed for both premium and cracked accounts. Our goal is to provide a seamless, optimized experience that enhances performance across all types of systems. Currently, the launcher is in active development, and we welcome contributions from the community.

## Features

- **Support for Premium and Cracked Accounts:** Whether you have a premium account or use a cracked version, SynthLauncher has you covered.
- **Optimized Performance:** We’re focused on maximizing performance, reducing load times, and minimizing resource usage to ensure a smooth Minecraft experience.
- **Open-Source:** SynthLauncher is completely open-source, and we encourage contributions from developers who share our vision.

## Current Status

**Launching the game is now possible! Every version works. We've added a Java installer and are planning to integrate Microsoft authentication. The latest code hasn't been pushed yet as we're still fixing some issues, but once everything is resolved, we'll push the update!**
