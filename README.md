## Features

- **Optimized Performance:** We’re focused on maximizing performance, reducing load times, and minimizing resource usage to ensure a smooth Minecraft experience.
- **Open-Source:** SynthLauncher is completely open-source, and we encourage contributions from developers who share our vision.
